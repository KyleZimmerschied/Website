Rule of thumb when naming files:

-   Human readable: info about content
    -   Numeric values always go first
    -   ISO 8601 standard (yyyy-mm-dd) for date (but would not recommend using date in the first place)
    -   Never delete leading 0.
-   Compatible with every system default ordering
-   Avoid spaces, uppercase.
