## Student Testimonials

I enjoyed the 5 minute snippets at the end. They were a good and engaging way to end class

The passion behind what he taught

Since our class was at 8 AM on Mondays + Wednesdays, there was always a lack of participation + energy, but Mike was always excited to teach and tried to make it fun

The feedback on assignment and discussion were great and descriptive

Mike was very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the course content

Always asked questions, and made sure we understood the lectures and projects

Mike was always energetic and tried his best to engage the class even during an 8 AM. He is very knowledgeable about the topics which is displayed through class every day. I really enjoyed this class this semester.
