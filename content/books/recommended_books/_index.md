In each section, books are listed in a recommended reading order.  

I do not endorse any bookseller. I try my best to find sources that are not a bookseller. But sometimes, Google Books does not have that books yet.  

Please enjoy!!!

**Note**: my book recommendations do not reflect the viewpoints of any of my affiliated organization, but mine lone.
