## __Working Papers__

+ We study the asset allocation, spending behavior, fees, and investment performance of U.S. private foundations. We find that large foundations          generate positive risk-adjusted returns of about one percent per year. Larger and more sophisticated foundations perform better and invest more         aggressively. Foundations with concentrated stock holdings have higher returns but also take on more risk. Because of the constraints imposed by the     five percent minimum spending rule and accommodating monetary policy, private foundations increase their risk-taking and reach for yield. Due to        these constraints, a conservative asset allocation will decrease real wealth over time resulting in less charitable giving.

2. {{< staticref "media/Innovation Decline IPO Draft.pdf" "newtab" >}}Does Innovation Decline Post-IPO?{{< /staticref >}}
    + See the {{< staticref "media/Innovation Decline IPO Slides.pdf" "newtab" >}}slides{{< /staticref >}}
+ Bernstein (2015) estimates that innovation quality decreases by 43 percent more post-IPO for firms that successfully go public to firms that file to     go public but ultimately withdrawal. I document that 54 percent of this magnitude is attributable to a negative survivorship bias from sample           selection. In addition, I find no effect when extending his results to 2012, partially attributable to the decline in relevance of his identification     strategy. I document an increase in trademark production for firms with completed IPOs which suggests public firms shift their innovative focus         towards commercialization. These results cast doubt on the adverse effects of going public on
    innovation and the recent IPO literature that instruments for IPO completion using
    the post-filing returns on the Nasdaq stock index.
