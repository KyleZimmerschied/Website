I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Trulaske College of Business](https://business.missouri.edu/) at the [University of Missouri](https://missouri.edu/). 

My research focuses on alternative investments, nonprofits, and entrepreneurial finance.

Prior to the Ph.D. program, I earned a Bachelor of Science in Economics (Honors), Bachelor of Science in Statistics, and a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with an emphasis in Finance from the [University of Missouri](https://missouri.edu/). 

Outside of research and teaching, I enjoy spending time with family, playing and coaching sports, and serving others.
