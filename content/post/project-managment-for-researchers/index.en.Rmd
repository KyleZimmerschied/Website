As a PhD student, it can be overwhelming sometimes with all the projects, courses (either teaching or taking), and conferences that you have to manage. Since I might not be the only one who struggle with this management task, I'd like to share my favorite project management app.

[Asana](https://asana.com/): great design, user-friendly, but cannot connect to other app (e.g., One Drive)

[Trello](https://trello.com/): greatly recommended by others, good for big projects, limited free options, and no templates for academic research, cannot connect to other apps

[Monday](monday.com): great template for academic research, can integrate with other apps well.

Hence, personally I use and suggest Monday for academic researchers.
