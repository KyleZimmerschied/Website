<p>As a PhD student, it can be overwhelming sometimes with all the projects, courses (either teaching or taking), and conferences that you have to manage. Since I might not be the only one who struggle with this management task, Iâ€™d like to share my favorite project management app.</p>
<p><a href="https://asana.com/">Asana</a>: great design, user-friendly, but cannot connect to other app (e.g., One Drive)</p>
<p><a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a>: greatly recommended by others, good for big projects, limited free options, and no templates for academic research, cannot connect to other apps</p>
<p><a href="monday.com">Monday</a>: great template for academic research, can integrate with other apps well.</p>
<p>Hence, personally I use and suggest Monday for academic researchers.</p>
