<p>I struggle to find how to make my figures and images perfectly aligned in the center of my book. After looking around, I think I’ve found an adequate solution:</p>
<p>Step 1: Change your image into <code>%</code> format.</p>
<p>Step 2: I typically change my width to <code>100</code>, but you can also leave it as is</p>
<p>Step 3: Go to <code>Attributes</code> tab can put this line into the “CSS styles” box: <code>display: block; margin: 1em auto</code></p>
<p>Voila! Now your image or figure should be robust to both bs4 or gitbook styles.</p>
