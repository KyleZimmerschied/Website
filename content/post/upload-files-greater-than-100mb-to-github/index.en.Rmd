What if you want to upload more than 100MB?

This is where [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/) comes in.

-   Step 1: After downloading it from the link above, type `git lfs isntall` in your "Terminal" (once per user account)

-   Step 2: Go to the folder that has the files you want to upload, type this command

`git lfs track "*.rds"`

where you can `rds` to any file types of your choice (e.g., mp4, jpeg, zip, etc.)

if you want to commit multiple types then

`git lfs track "*.jpg" "*.png" "*.mp4"`

then, run

`git add .gitattributes`

Alternatively, you can also directly edit your `.gitattributes` file

Then, you are done. You can proceed to commit and push to GitHub like usual.
