When you write your posts/blogs on blogdown, you might not want to always refer to the absolute path appeared on your website (because you might change your domain name and all hell breaks loose).

Then, to specify relative path you can

-   Step 1: Change your `config.toml` file by searching for `[permalinks]` then include relative path for your post:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
[permalinks] 
    authors = "/author/:slug/" 
    tags = "/tag/:slug/" 
    categories = "/category/:slug/" 
    publication_types = "/publication-type/:slug/" 
    post = "/post/:slug"
```

-   Step 2: Then you can start writing like usual again. For example, you can find the last post `[here](/post/slug_name_for_other_post/)` where `here` will be highlighted with the URL to the other post.
