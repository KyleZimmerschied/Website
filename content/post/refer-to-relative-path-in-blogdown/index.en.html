<p>When you write your posts/blogs on blogdown, you might not want to always refer to the absolute path appeared on your website (because you might change your domain name and all hell breaks loose).</p>
<p>Then, to specify relative path you can</p>
<ul>
<li>Step 1: Change your <code>config.toml</code> file by searching for <code>[permalinks]</code> then include relative path for your post:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>[permalinks] 
    authors = &quot;/author/:slug/&quot; 
    tags = &quot;/tag/:slug/&quot; 
    categories = &quot;/category/:slug/&quot; 
    publication_types = &quot;/publication-type/:slug/&quot; 
    post = &quot;/post/:slug&quot;</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Step 2: Then you can start writing like usual again. For example, you can find the last post <code>[here](/post/slug_name_for_other_post/)</code> where <code>here</code> will be highlighted with the URL to the other post.</li>
</ul>
