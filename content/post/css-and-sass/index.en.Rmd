CSS = Cascading Style Sheets

 * Selector 
 * Declaration
 
To add CSS to Shiny: 

 * Add styling to tags 
 * Add CSS to HTML header
 * Add style sheets with the www directory (most ideal)


SASS = Systematically Awesome Style Sheets (built on top of CSS)

SASS | CSS
---|---
Object oriented | Statement oriented 
Allows nesting | No nesting 
Allows variables | Limited variable declaration
