<p>It’s possible to have basic statistics from bookdown using <code>connectapi</code> (<a href="https://github.com/sol-eng/connect-usage">basic example</a>). However, this feature is very limited.</p>
<p>Hence, it is better to <a href="(%7B%7B%3C%20relref%20%22../2021-08-14-how-to-connect-bookdown-with-google-analytics%22%20%3E%7D%7D)">connect bookdown to Google Analytics</a> to have better metrics. However, the trade-off is that you can’t see every book’s performance at once even though they are all under one account, since it is in one property. You could use Roll-up report, but then you will have to pay to use that feature.</p>
<p>Another solution is to use Google Analytics API and write your R script to see customized performance of all your books.</p>
