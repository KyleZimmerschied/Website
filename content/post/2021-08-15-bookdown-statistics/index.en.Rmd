It's possible to have basic statistics from bookdown using `connectapi` ([basic example](https://github.com/sol-eng/connect-usage)). However, this feature is very limited. 

Hence, it is better to [connect bookdown to Google Analytics](({{< relref "../2021-08-14-how-to-connect-bookdown-with-google-analytics" >}})) to have better metrics. However, the trade-off is that you can't see every book's performance at once even though they are all under one account, since it is in one property. You could use Roll-up report, but then you will have to pay to use that feature. 

Another solution is to use Google Analytics API and write your R script to see customized performance of all your books.
