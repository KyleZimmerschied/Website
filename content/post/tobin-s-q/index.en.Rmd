# Tobin's Q

According to Kerin and Sethuraman [@Kerin_1998, p. 261], **Tobins q** is the "ratio of the market value of the firm to the replacement cost of its tangible assets, property, plant, equipment, inventory, cash, and investments in stocks and bonds".  

**Market-to-book ratio** is the equity capitalization of a firm divided by book equity. Equivalently, (share price multiplied by number of shares) over (common stock equity, capital surplus, and retained earnings).  


**Market-to-book ratio** and **Tobin's q** have been shown to be equivalent measures [@Chung_1994]
