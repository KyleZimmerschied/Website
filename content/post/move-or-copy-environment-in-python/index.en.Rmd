It's likely that at some point in you data analysis or research career, you will have to either move or copy your current working/virtual environment in Python (in Anaconda or any other platform) to a new location (e.g., virtual machine, new work station) 

To do so, you can copy your old working environment by exporting it. In your console, type:

```{python, eval = FALSE}
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

This code helps you create a new `requirements.txt` file in your current working directory. If you don't know where you are (type `os.getcwd()`)

Then move this file to your new location, and in the console type 

```{python, eval = FALSE}
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can also edit the `requirements.txt` if you want by 

 1. Including more packages in the format: `<package_name> == <version>`
 2. Specify the range of the package: `<package_name> >= <version>, <= <version>`
