<p>It’s likely that at some point in you data analysis or research career, you will have to either move or copy your current working/virtual environment in Python (in Anaconda or any other platform) to a new location (e.g., virtual machine, new work station)</p>
<p>To do so, you can copy your old working environment by exporting it. In your console, type:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt</code></pre>
<p>This code helps you create a new <code>requirements.txt</code> file in your current working directory. If you don’t know where you are (type <code>os.getcwd()</code>)</p>
<p>Then move this file to your new location, and in the console type</p>
<pre class="python"><code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></pre>
<p>You can also edit the <code>requirements.txt</code> if you want by</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Including more packages in the format: <code>&lt;package_name&gt; == &lt;version&gt;</code></li>
<li>Specify the range of the package: <code>&lt;package_name&gt; &gt;= &lt;version&gt;, &lt;= &lt;version&gt;</code></li>
</ol>
