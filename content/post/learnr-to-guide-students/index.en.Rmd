Teaching statistics or data science, we can use `learnr` package. 

```{r eval FALSE}
# library("learnr")
```

To collect data, we can use `learnrhash`

```{r eval = FALSE}
# library("learnrhash")
```

Remember to adjust parameters so your `Shinyapp.io` can handle the number of students you have in the class. Or you can upload it to GitHub, then students can install to your local machine later.
