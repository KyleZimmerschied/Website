You can read more in Michael Barrowman's
[post](https://michaelbarrowman.co.uk/post/the-new-base-pipe/)

But the basic idea is that using the new pipe `|>` from the `magrittr` library
is much faster than your old pipe `%>%`

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("magrittr")
remotes::install_github("Myko101/magrittrclassic")
library("magrittr")
library("tidyverse")
doubler <- function(val) 2*val
x <- 1:10
bm <- bench::mark(
  standard = doubler(x),
  magrittrclassic = x %>>% doubler(),
  magrittr = x %>% doubler(),
  base = x |> doubler()
)
ggplot2::autoplot(bm)
```
