<p>If you work with bookdown, Latex, Python, or anything that uses BibTex as the underlying citation document, you will understand the struggle that sometimes your document cannot be rendered correctly because you might miss a comma, year, or author. But in R, you will not know where to look for the error. Hence, two websites help me a lot with this process:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://flamingtempura.github.io/bibtex-tidy/">Bibtex-tidy</a>: It will automatically reformat everything for you. I usually choose to have the document sorted by “author”.</li>
<li><a href="https://biblatex-linter.herokuapp.com/">Lint your BibLatex</a>: It will find the exact troublesome citation for you.</li>
</ul>
