To solve the problem of scaling:

 * From DevOps/IT:
    - Add memory, CPU
    - Rstudio Connect set up for multiple machines 
 * From R/Shiny engineer:
    - use [Javascript](https://book.javascript-for-r.com/shiny-intro.html) for less CPU usage
    - extract computations: [Shiny worker](https://appsilon.com/shiny-worker-package/), [Plumber](https://www.rplumber.io/)
    - use a [database](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/overview.html)
