<p>I accidentally commit files greater than 100 MB (which is against GitHub’s policy - only files less than 100MB). Hence, you should always either</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Ignore the files by including their names in the <code>.gitignore</code> files. You can either write the name of the file or use <code>*</code> (e.g., <code>*.rds</code> to ignore any files with <code>rds</code> ending).</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://git-lfs.github.com/">Git Large File Storage</a> to store the files. This step is covered in <a href="/post/upload-files-greater-than-100mb-to-github/">this post</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Back to our problems, how can we delete the wrong commits?</p>
<p>Luckily we can use <code>bfg.jar</code>, which could be downloaded from <a href="https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/">here</a>. I usually move the file to my GitHub directory that I want to use. But you can also leave it wherever you want.</p>
<p>To delete the wrong commits, you can either go to “Terminal”, or I usually just to the “Terminal” tab in RStudio. Then, you can type</p>
<p><code>java -jar bfg.jar --strip-blobs-bigger-than 100M &lt;your_repo&gt;</code></p>
<p>For example, I use</p>
<p><code>java -jar bfg-1.14.0.jar --strip-blobs-bigger-than 100M C:/Users/tn9k4/GitHub/finance</code></p>
<p>where I have to change <code>bfg.jar</code> because my file has its version in its name (or you can also change your <code>bfg.jar</code> to match with your command) and my git repo is <code>C:/Users/tn9k4/GitHub/finance</code></p>
<p>To find your git repo, you can also type in the “Terminal” tab</p>
<p><code>git rev-parse --show-toplevel</code></p>
<p>Please don’t include <code>.git</code> in the repo location.</p>
