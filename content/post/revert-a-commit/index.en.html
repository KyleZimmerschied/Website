<p>Iâ€™ve recently committed a cardinal sin of pulling a merge without checking. And then, I had to try to revert back to my original commit. However, I also encounter an error saying <code>non-fast-forward</code>. Hence, you have to do the following steps for a correct revert</p>
<pre><code>git revert {commit_id}
git push origin -f</code></pre>
<p>After typing in your password, you should be reverted to the original state of the commit ID.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: To check your commit_id, on the right-hand side of Rstudio, you can see a clock next to the green up arrow. In the changes tab, you should see the column <code>SHA</code>, which is the string of the commit id that you want to get.</p>
