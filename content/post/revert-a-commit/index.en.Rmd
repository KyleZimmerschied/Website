I've recently committed a cardinal sin of pulling a merge without checking. And then, I had to try to revert back to my original commit. However, I also encounter an error saying `non-fast-forward`. Hence, you have to do the following steps for a correct revert 

```
git revert {commit_id}
git push origin -f
```

After typing in your password, you should be reverted to the original state of the commit ID. 

**Note**: To check your commit_id, on the right-hand side of Rstudio, you can see a clock next to the green up arrow. In the changes tab, you should see the column `SHA`, which is the string of the commit id that you want to get.
