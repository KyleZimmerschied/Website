Check where your package is installed

```{r}
find.package("dplyr")
```


All projects use the same library path. Then for each project, you need different library dependencies.

## Intializing a project 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
renv::init()
```

A `.Rprofile` is created that forks the current R libraries. 

Now, you can work as before. But the current state of packages would not change. 

## Snapshot
```{r, eval=FALSE}
renv::snapshot()
```

The function tells you the current state of a project, and whether you can to update any packages in that project.  

The lockfile is a JSON file that tells you packages installed in your project, versions, and sources. 


This is useful for:  

 * Time capsules (you can return to this project in the future without any unexpected changes)
 * Collaborative workflows (different people might have different packages installed).
 * Deployments (you can run your project remotely)


## Restore 
To restore the previously snapshot, you can use 

```{r}
renv::restore()
```



Other packages

 * `groundhog`: `groundhog.library('dplyr', '2016-06-20')`
 * `checkpoint`
 * `Docker`
